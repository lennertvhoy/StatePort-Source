"""StatePort no-checkout, website-compatible installer (stdlib-only bootstrap).

Installs a signed StatePort release on any capability-matching portable Linux
host (Linux/amd64, cgroup v2, rootless Podman at or above the required floor,
Quadlet, systemd user services, and subordinate UID/GID mappings) without any
source checkout, from downloaded release artifacts.  Distribution branding is
observation, never eligibility: a host whose runtime contract matches but
which lacks a clean-install acceptance receipt installs with an explicit
``compatible_unvalidated`` notice and that tier is recorded in the install
receipt.  The script is Python 3.12+ standard-library only; the release
contracts and updater engine are loaded from the digest-verified updater
wheel, never from a checkout.

Trust order (every step fails closed):

1. The operator pins the trust root out of band: the Cosign trust public key,
   its key ID, and its SHA-256 DER SubjectPublicKeyInfo fingerprint.  The
   fingerprint of the supplied PEM is recomputed in pure stdlib (PEM armor is
   base64 DER SPKI) and must match the pinned value exactly.
2. Bootstrap authentication: the pinned Cosign executable (``--cosign``,
   required; nothing is downloaded implicitly) verifies the release-index
   signature bundle over the canonical signed payload.  The payload bytes are
   re-derived here with the exact ``stateport.canonical-json/v1`` subset
   (sorted keys, tight separators, UTF-8, no floats) and must hash to the
   signature descriptor's ``subjectDigest`` before Cosign is even invoked.
3. Only now is the index content trusted for one purpose: pinning digests.
   The updater wheel is hashed and compared against ``artifacts.updater`` in
   the authenticated signed payload, then installed into an isolated venv
   with ``pip --no-index --no-deps`` (the single digest-pinned wheel is the
   hash-locked requirement; the wheel has no runtime dependencies).
4. ``stateport_release`` and ``stateport_updater`` are imported from that
   venv.  The index is then re-verified end to end with
   ``verify_release_index`` (schema, canonical digests, channel, target,
   expiry, scan freshness, image signatures) using the pinned-key verifier.
   Any divergence between the bootstrap parse and the contract parse refuses.

Genesis boundary (documented, fail-closed): a fresh install has no
predecessor, so the revision validation/promotion ceremony has no typed
producer in this codebase.  The installer therefore creates the exact empty
genesis data volumes and their snapshot copies, records a genuine
``stateport.revision-validation-backup-receipt/v1`` (``sourceDataGeneration``
null, quiesced because no writer exists at genesis), and calls
``materialize_verified_quadlet_bundle`` — never hand-rendered units.  Only
the accepted-profile artifacts are copied into the user's live Quadlet root;
their pending ``@@STATEPORT_ACCEPTED_DATA_VOLUME:*`` tokens are resolved with
the exact genesis named volumes (the same substitution the contract performs
in ``materialize_accepted_quadlet_bundle``, which itself requires promotion
receipts no producer can issue at genesis).  Validation-profile units stay
staged and are never installed or started.  Later updates go through the
installed updater's typed ceremony.

Updater genesis: the alpha release line is pinned-public-key, and the
installed updater's typed proof contract accepts pinned-key admissions.  The
installer creates the durable trust root exactly once (create-only
``updater/trust/<keyId>.pem`` plus the self-digested
``stateport.internal-update-trust-root/v1`` record), initializes the updater
engine against the pinned policy with the real Cosign verifier, records the
schema-valid ``installed-initialize`` admission (``trustMode:
pinned-public-key``), installs the bound installed-authority identity
(installation ID, release ID, index/installer digests, target, state root,
channel), and records the durable ``install-trust.json`` fact.  A
``updater/genesis-boundary.json`` deferral record from a pre-contract install
is a historic artifact, not an outcome of this installer.

Execution-host provisioning boundary (fail-closed): when the verified target
declares a stable execution host, the installer renders the exact provisioning
plan from the signature-verified release (``signature-verified-install``) and
writes it to ``execution-host-provisioning-plan.json`` in the state root —
 create-only, foreign content refuses closed.  Provisioning is a separate,
 explicitly root step through the fixed root-owned host helper; it
 re-verifies the release cryptographically,
   re-renders and cross-checks the plan, revalidates immediately before the
   first privileged write, and writes a create-only root-owned receipt below
    ``/var/lib/stateport-provisioning/receipts``.  This rootless installer never
    runs that transaction; its only escalated calls are fixed-shape ``sudo -n``
    operations inside the ``stateport-control`` account's own session (its podman
    volumes at install; its units, containers, volumes and quadlet files at
    uninstall/purge), and it refuses to claim install success until that exact receipt —
    carrying the privileged transaction's digest-bound protocol-health proof,
    recorded after probing the confined socket as the allowed client — is
    present and matches this exact release and plan.

Uninstall and purge (recorded authority only, converge on partial state):
``--uninstall`` loads the durable installation record (``install-trust.json``
plus the staged materialization manifest) and reverses exactly what install
did — it stops and disables the recorded systemd user units, removes the
recorded containers by exact name, deletes the exact live Quadlet files the
installer materialized, and reloads the user manager.  The control plane runs
as the ``stateport-control`` account, so its part (units, containers, network,
volumes, Quadlet files, activation target) is reached with
``sudo -n runuser -u stateport-control -- env -i ... <absolute program>`` (no
``sudo`` when already root), refused up front with ``administrator_rights_required``
when ``sudo`` would prompt.  Data volumes are looked up in the store that owns them
(the control account's); a purge also removes same-named leftovers that earlier
installers created in the installing user's own store.  All genesis data
volumes, snapshot volumes, the state root with every durable record, and the
updater venv are preserved, and a durable
``stateport.internal-install-uninstall-receipt/v1`` records every removed and
preserved name so a later purge or reinstall can read what happened.
``--purge`` additionally removes the recorded genesis data and snapshot
volumes and deletes the state root contents; it refuses closed unless
``--confirm-purge`` names the exact installed identity ID from the durable
record, and its receipt is written to ``<state-root>.purge-receipt.json``
before any state root deletion.  Both modes are idempotent: missing units,
containers, files, or volumes are convergence, and every step touches only
names from the durable record — never a glob, never a foreign resource, and
no external side-effect reversal is ever claimed.

Provider-owned OpenCode sign-in stays outside these volumes and survives both
uninstall and purge. Use OpenCode itself in the installed provider environment
before runtime removal when sign-out is intended; no credential files are read
or deleted by StatePort cleanup.

No ``curl | sh``, no mutable tags, no shell, no silent fallback.  Every
refusal is typed and durable; where the receipt schema has every required
fact, a failed run writes a schema-conformant receipt with ``result:
failed`` — earlier refusals write a typed refusal record instead of a
half-populated receipt.  Durable state uses write-ahead intent plus atomic
rename, so an interrupted install is safely re-runnable and converges.

_EMBEDDED_PROVIDER_ADOPTION_SOURCE = r'''"""Adopt an already signed-in OpenCode into the managed provider home.

OpenCode keeps every sign-in it performs, stock providers and OpenCode Go
alike, in one file: ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/auth.json`` (default
``~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json``), a JSON object keyed by provider id
whose values are ``{"type": "api", "key": ...}`` or ``{"type": "oauth", ...}``
records. ``opencode.json`` under ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode`` is user
configuration (plugins, MCP servers, permissions), not a sign-in, and it can
carry unrelated or secret settings, so it is deliberately never adopted.

Adoption is a one-way COPY of the SELECTED provider records of that file into
the StatePort provider home, where the managed OpenCode subprocess already
looks for it (``<home>/data/opencode/auth.json``, see
``opencode_subprocess_environment``):

* only the record(s) of the selected provider id(s) are written; unrelated
  providers (for example an OAuth login for another vendor) are never copied.
  Selection order: an explicit id list (each must be present in the source),
  else the provider named by the model currently selected in StatePort
  (``<provider>/<model>``), else ``opencode-go`` / ``opencode`` when present,
  else the adoption is refused and the detected NAMES are listed;
* the copy is a regular file written with mode 0600 by the service's own
  uid inside a 0700 directory chain; a symbolic link is never created and a
  symbolic-linked source is refused. Every destination component is opened
  with O_NOFOLLOW relative to a directory descriptor, so a path component
  swapped for a symbolic link while adopting cannot redirect the write;
* the source is parsed in memory; the only things ever recorded or returned
  are presence, a timestamp, the source path and the provider NAMES (map keys);
* OAuth caveat: OpenCode rotates an OAuth refresh token whenever it refreshes
  one. A copied OAuth record that refreshes inside StatePort can invalidate the
  original OpenCode sign-in. Prefer API-key providers (opencode-go) for adoption;
* values are never logged, returned, written to a receipt or transmitted, and
  no error text embeds file content.

The module is standard-library only so the host-side installer helper can
load it by file path without importing the application package.

"""Host-side adoption of the owner's already signed-in OpenCode.

Run this on the machine (the WSL distribution) where OpenCode is already
signed in. It COPIES only the SELECTED provider record(s) out of the file
OpenCode keeps every sign-in in, ``~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json``, into
the three StatePort places that need it. Unrelated providers in that file are
never copied. Selection: ``--provider ID`` (repeatable, must be present), else
the provider of ``--model`` (``<provider>/<model>``), else ``opencode-go`` /
``opencode`` when present, else the helper refuses and lists the detected names.

1. the managed provider home        (control plane, mode 0600, stateport-control)
2. the control agent-provider dir   (mode 0600, stateport-control; the control
   service reads it as its own uid)
3. the execution agent-provider dir (mode 0640, owner stateport-exec, group =
   the host gid the sealed container's gid 10001 maps to, derived from the
   stateport-exec entry in /etc/subgid under rootless podman ``--userns host``)

Copy 3 is read by the sealed agent workspace container (``--user 10001:10001``,
see stateport-agent-run), through the GROUP bit; it is never world-readable. If
the mapped gid cannot be determined the copy stays 0600 and the helper says so:
the provisioner must then chown it to the mapped gid before an agent can use it.
(provider.env is provisioned separately and is not touched here.)

OAuth caveat: OpenCode rotates an OAuth refresh token when it refreshes it. An
OAuth record copied here that refreshes inside StatePort can sign the original
OpenCode out; prefer an API-key provider such as opencode-go.

Nothing is symlinked, the source is never modified, every destination component
is opened with O_NOFOLLOW relative to a directory descriptor (a component
swapped for a symlink cannot redirect root's write), and no value is ever
printed, logged or sent anywhere: the report names paths, sizes, modes and
provider NAMES only.

Normally the in-product "Adopt existing OpenCode sign-in" action does copy 1
by itself; this helper exists for the cases it cannot reach (the container
cannot read the host home, the provider home is owned by another uid) and for
the two agent-provider directories, which are read-only mounts in the web
container.

Writing into the root-provisioned directories needs root (``sudo``); use
``--dry-run`` to see what would happen. ``--model`` also writes the ``model``
file the agent run requires.
